","I ordered the google Chromecast because of the price. I have a Apple TV in my main living area and really enjoy it. I just didn't want to spend another $99 just to watch Netflix and YouTube. The Chromecast was just $29.99 with my prime membership. Shipping was fast. It arrived in 2 business days. I live in a older building and I am unable to get cable in the bedroom, so the Chromecast was the best alternative. The Setup took only a few minutes. I connected to it to my wifi I love to watch Youtube and Netflix on it. Actually Youtube shows better on the Chromecast than the Apple TV IMO. It doesn't come with a remote but I have a galaxy s4 and I use it as the remote with the watch on app. I do like that I can use my ipad and iPhone as well to control it. Overall its a great product for the money and what I use it for.
Awesome product! Simple solution to streaming content from your Mac, PC, iOS or Android device. There is the occasional lag when videos are loading. If this happens to you look up the chrome plugins you need to disable and it should fix the problem.
This one of the best purchases I have made.  I love that I can stream shows from my iphone and laptop instantly.  My only regret is not buying this sooner!
Maybe it will be better when you can use it to cast personal stuff like photos. For now, we don't have much use for it.
I'm a big Plex user.  The software update to Chromecast messed up my Plex transmission.  I wish I would have known this before I purchased it.
My husband love Chromecast so much he want to purchase a another, I would admits it's easier than using the laptop which have a be connected Aurum Cables 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable and PTC Mini-DVI to HDMI Adapter with 6ft HDMI Cable for Macintosh and more. So yes go ahead and buy it,  on like my hubby i'll just move the one we have from living room to bed room.
Outstanding and is everything it claims to be.  I just wish it was supported by more apps (e.g. mobile chrome, skype, hangouts, etc!).
Wow.  I'm pretty impressed by this item.  Don't forget to add 'Videostream' (by Google) to your Google Chrome account, that is so that you can stream any file on your computer/storage device to your television via the Chromecast device.  Really neat.",8,799,"Product: Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player
Summary: The Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player is a cost-effective and simple solution for streaming content from multiple devices.

","I've really enjoyed my kindle fire hdx from listening to music to reading, or just playing apps.  it's small light you can take it pretty much anywhere and it has a good battery life.
i love my kindle for reading, movies. My grands love  it for games and videos.  It's child friendly.  And very durable.
This is the first small tablet I have owned.  I love reading books on it.  It is small enough to carry in my purse and the white, intensity-adjustable background is just wonderful!
Love love love this kindle. This kindle delivered everything it promised and more! I own a older kindle fire and knew I needed to upgrade. I saw the HDX was on sale and started saving up for it. I am a die-hard kindle user and I am so glad I got it. When I look at movies on the kindle the picture it is just like watching my flat screen tv. If anyone is thinking about getting a tablet get the 7 HDX you won't can't go wrong and this is coming from a senior citizen.
I ordered on Tuesday and it was at my door Wednesday. Now all I have to do is learn how great it is. My wife has one and her's is great.
, it just has so many things that I will need help with.  I WILL  use the website and maybe  my niece who also has one.
love it, just wish it had a light to show that it is charging...other wise I really like it.
I love my Kindle fires. I'd give this one 5 stars of it had a front facing camera. My only complaint!",8,582,"Product: Kindle Fire HDX 7"", HDX Display (Previous Generation - 3rd)

","Easy to set up and use, love  the little cover that acts as a stand.
for the price this is the best. Big enough screen, great reader, and it has the apps I want.
Make sure you protect your contacts and files with a good virus protection package. I didn't do it right away and I did pay for it after it was too late. I managed to get rid of the virus before it created too much damage so take heed and install a virus protection app as soon as you get the chance.
Nice
So far, I LOVE IT.  It is small, fast, and exactly what I was looking for. I got the Citron color and I love it!
It is amazing
This newest version is not as good as the previous kindle fire I own. About half of the time I try to swop the screen to open it, the screen come back blank. I have to reboot the kindle just to get it working again. It's extremely frustrating.
WONDERFUL! One of the best purchases I have made in awhile !",8,450,"Product: Fire HD 7, 7"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB
Summary: The Amazon Fire HD 7 provides high-quality performance for its price.

","Great!
I didnt care for these personally, (they didn't fit my big earholes.<br />But, the person I gave these as a gift to, loves them a lot.<br />They rave about them.<br /><br />so I think they are ok.. just didn't fit me.
Now, these are generally OK headphones. I give them an ok cuz they generally conk out after a few months but when they work the sound quality is pretty good. Usually it's one ear or the other that will go first and then they become useless. I was mad because this particular pair I received was just broke. I plugged it into my ipod and the sound quality was in and out, garbled, you couldn't even hear the music well. So overall, when they're working they're nice but they won't last you very long.
Excellent earphones for the $$$. Long lasting. Good sound. They stay in your ear when walking.
The headphones are an amazing value, however I only received one each of the small and large ear pieces. I'm sure it was just an error in manufacturing/processing, but it was a little disappointing since the large earpieces fit me best.
Didn't expect such sound quality with such cheap price
I have a super difficult time finding earphones that fit and stay in place while I am running. I have tried them all, even the Yurbuds that claim to stay in place no matter what! These little gems are puuurrrrrfect! SO glad I bought them...am buying more to stock up just in case they stop making them for some strange reason!

Summary: The Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphone offers a comfortable, secure fit and decent sound quality for a budget price. However, the durability of the product is a concern, as some users have reported issues with the headphones breaking down within a few months of use. Despite these drawbacks, many customers appreciate the value of the headphones and are satisfied with their performance overall.

Fantastic game but the cardboard was ripped when I got it.
You can not go wrong with this game. Just need to get the expansion packs now. Even better to play while having a few beverages.
This is a very good party game as long as no one in the room is politically correct.  Highly recommend this game.
Purchased for my sister for Christmas!  Played it at our family Christmas dinner; it had us all in stitches!
LOVE THIS GAME!!!
Such a fun game - we've had a ton of fun nights with it already! It's only appropriate for adults!
While I am not sure about its educational value I rated this game 5 stars all around because it is that amazing. Apples to apples has become a game for sissies. This livens up any gathering or party!",8,453,"Product: Cards Against Humanity
Summary: Cards Against Humanity is a hilariously inappropriate game that will have you in stitches, especially if you have a group of friends who like to indulge in a bit of adult humor. It's perfect for parties and gatherings, but be sure to save it for a mature audience. Just be careful of overplaying it, as it may wear off its novelty. The packaging could use an improvement, but overall, this game is a must-have for anyone looking for a good time.

","Good battery life, bright screen.  I read in all kinds of light with no problem, love that I can carry multiple magazines and books with me at all times.  The only thing I'd change is the location of the power button (on the bottom where it gets punched off sometimes)  I can just turn the kindle upside down for most books, but magazines seem to have a permanent orientation.
I love everything about it, had the regular kindle before and it was great as well.  Love the size.  Battery life is only draw back for it.
Great product. Would recommend to anyone wanting a electronic reader. Not an Ipad but for the price great value. Get it now.
I wanted some technology to be able to enjoy some of the features others have with smartphones, but without the monthly data fees from cellular companies.  I am able to read, watch movies, check email and take advantage of Apps (my favorite right now is Words with Friends).  So far I haven't left an environment with wireless available, but most of the places I go have wireless so hopefully that won't be an issue.  Love the size of the screen and the clarity of the images and print.  Various font settings are also available.
This is an all around let down. From no bluetooth, to the weight, to the response of the touch screen, the power button, speakers, choppyness.. practically a complete failure.
Wonderful for people with good eyesight. I had a hard time reading with it but my daughter loves it and is on it every day. Lots of fun games to play and books to read. Easy internet access and ready to use right out of the box.<br /> Works the best with Amazon Prime.
People continue to base there opinion of this device by comparing it to an iPad.  Although an iPad can do tons of stuff and are awesome, 95% of iPad owners (that I know) use it for listening to music, watching Netflix or online videos, reading, playing games or just browsing the internet.  The Kindle Fire can do all that at a fraction of the cost.  I bought one Fire for me and one for my wife and we both love them.  I have both of these Kindles associated with the same amazon prime account so all of our applications and content is shared.  Some people have complained alot about how someone would be able to see what you have been doing on the internet or what videos you have been watching, and I just wonder if you are doing things that might embarrass you then you should probably not be showing your new Kindle Fire to people. I expect that Amazon will most likely come out with an update soon allowing for some more customization for the carousel and allow certain content to be \\""left out\\"" especially because this has been a sore spot for many people.  I find that the Kindle Fire is easy to use and even not all that difficult to put applications on it from outside sources (android marketplace).  This is a great little device and would make an awesome gift without having to spend $500+ for an iPad.
I got this for my husband-for his birthday--seems in great shape-have yet to totally test it--one item of note--there are no manuals-or information if a warrenty exists--the pocket that should have contained Kindle Fire information was empty--",8,924,"Product: Kindle Fire (Previous Generation - 1st)
Summary: The Kindle Fire (Previous Generation - 1st) is an affordable alternative to iPad with a decent battery life and a bright screen. It is suitable for reading materials and can accommodate multiple books and magazines at once. It also offers a good variety of apps for entertainment. One drawback is the location of the power button which can be inconvenient at times. Some customers also complained about the response of the touch screen and the absence of Bluetooth. However, it performs well when it comes to basic functions such as checking email, browsing the internet, and watching movies.

User: 

5/5 - Fits in my bag perfectly. I had to dismiss reviews indicating retina screen, various versions, Wi-Fi and cellular, as those annoying reviews are for comments about customer service. The package on arrival was a little damaged but it worked fine. The screen is bright and easy to read, the battery life is amazing and considering the price I'd rate this 5 stars. 

5/5 - Great but for the price I would have expected Bluetooth and a better responsive touch screen. The current version isn't Bluetooth enabled and the touch screen is slow reacting at times. If it was Bluetooth enabled and had a faster touch screen I would rate this 6 stars. 

5/5 - Works great for reading books and playing games but sometimes freeze for a few seconds while using the touch screen. Overall a great device considering the prices. 

4/5 - The packaging of the Kindle was damaged on arrival, but that didn't affect the product. Now let's talk about the product. The device is not extremely fast and there were times when the touchscreen was unresponsive. However, it holds a charge for a long time and the picture and sound quality are good. 

3/5 - The digital reading experience was great but not really satisfied with the interactive reading experience, the battery dies really quickly, not really durable enough, and the quality of movies is not that good. 

3/5 - Kindle Fire turned out to be a big letdown and hugely disappointing. There were various issues such as the response of the touch screen, the power button, speakers and so on. 

3/5 - I bought this for my kid to access internet but the response was slow and the battery life is pretty terrible. Overall, a disappointment from Amazon. 

4/5 - The Kindle was alright, I liked being able to read and listen to music. Can't say I am totally in love with this Kindle Fire but it's generally a good device just doesn't match the hype. 

3/5 - Would have been a lot better"

working great after 1 year in Sandisk Sansa Clip+ for expanded storage
great price
I anticipate getting one of these for my Galaxy SIV; on order presently. I only wanted to 'astound' perhaps one or two reviewers with my recollection about purchasing a 1 Gig SD card from CompUSA (defunct, sadly) in their store at Dunwoody, Georgia's Perimeter Mall. This was at Christmas in 2004. I purchased the 1 Gig card for my then-groundbreaking Treo 650. The cost was $100 for the card. The Treo was purchased from Sprint PCS in Roswell, GA and it cost $650. I bought a Treo and a 1 Gig card for my girlfriend up north too as I had recently been transferred to Atlanta and I was homesick and wanted to stay in-touch via the latest technology. I still have my Treo and that pioneering (for me) 1 Gig SD card and both still work. The 1 Gig card still holds 'vintage' photos and videos of the era and I have transferred the contents innumerable times to many devices.<br /><br />In terms of size, cost and capacity I am amazed at how far things have advanced. Color me impressed with the utility of a 64 Gig Micro SD card for under one buck per gigabyte. Thank you for reading and entertaining my musings.
I purchased this disk to use in my tablet and it works very well and because it came with an adapter, I can also use it on my PC.
Works great in my GPS was able to download complete maps of the US & Canada and not have to use internal memory.
I am disappointed with this product. Over the last year I have purchase several dozen of these for data logging purposes. I choose Sandisk as they have a good name for reliability. However I have found that around 30% of the cards have been faulty straight out of the box. I have raised the issue with Sandisk whom admitted to the problem and stated &#34;Now all the new cards are functional and tested. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and will not be doing any faults again&#34;.<br /><br />A quick google reveals that they have been aware of the problem sine early 2013. What is disappointing is that they have not removed the bad cards from the supply line, so I am still receiving bad ones from Amazon. They get away with it because many consumers will not notice for a period of time  - it is not apparent until the card begins to get full, at which point it stops accepting data and effectively becomes 'read-only'.<br /><br />I suggest anyone purchasing this product should test it by filling it up with data, as in my experience there is a good chance it will fail. Thankfully Amazon are gracious about accepting returns.

","perfect....just what I needed!
Fantastic device. We purchased 3. The kids free time app is exactly what I needed to control the safety and appropriateness of content viewed by my 10 year old. I would like to see a few things updated such as what is unlimited and just for purchase on my wish list without having to open the book information. It would be nice to be able to just return unlimited books to the shop without checking out to get that option as we share the unlimited account and are unsure what people have finished (it would be nice to have a pop up at the last page of the book).
Without a microSD slot for additional storage, I won't be interested. I am aware that cloud storage is available, but Amazon and these other companies that produce devices with no expandable storage need to understand that WiFi is simply not as all-pervasive as they believe. In my small town, when I'm not at home or at a few commercial locations I'm off the grid and restricted to the content that can be stored on the device itself.
I love it! It's so easy to use and everything you need is at the push of a button.

Summary: The Fire HD 6 is an easy to use, lightweight tablet that offers user-friendly parental controls to monitor your child's usage.

","it only worked for about 3 months do not buy used stuff from this seller!
I love my new Kindle. So many things I can access. Works great!!! I just wish there was a little more music, movies and books that could be free.
I HAVE A TABLET BUT IT DOES'NT COMPARE TO MY KINDLE!!!!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!  MY GRANDKIDS LIKE PLAYING THE FREE GAMES THAT CAME ON IT
Love my Kindle!  I resisted buying one for so long because I love the feel and smell of an actual book.  But, this Kindle is super practical.  I can keep tons of books with me at all times without having to carry around the bulk and weight of actual books.  I can watch movies, use the internet, read research articles I have downloaded and even take notes on them.  It's great to carry with me on vacations when I want to be able to do things like read a few articles and check my emails for work on occasion, read on the beach or in the hotel, get some online shopping done.<br /><br />The screen resolution is great for video, but I don't really play games on it.<br /><br />The camera is not so fantastic, but then I am used to the quality of a DSLR, so most phones / tablets have cameras that I am not very impressed by.<br /><br />It's lightweight and durable, the size of a book really.  Has a locking function to keep your data safe. And costs far less than an iPad would.<br /><br />Probably the best purchase I've made all year.
I gave this to my wife, and she really likes it.<br />Not sure what the special offers are, but we are delighted with the kindle.
at first I didn't want the kindle fire but I have grown to love it
I strongly recommend not to settle for this inferior product. You even don't get what you pay for since it simply does not work. So it is basically no money worth at all.<br /><br />What was my issue? The Kindle connected to my wireless network for one hour but when stopped connecting. And as you know without wireless connection it is just worthless. I researched the Internet, tried all recommended tricks, called Amazon tech support but just did not get it work. After 3 hours I gave up and just decided to return the Kindle. I have several devices on my wireless network router (laptops, printers, iPad, Xbox, Wii, DVR) and non of them made ever problems. Thus it is a Kindle issue. Researching the internet I also saw that many, many customers seem to have that problem and I wish I had read the feedback earlier.<br />Also, the short hour I had the Kindle operating I just need to say Apple iPad is just better. It starts faster, it is more easy to handle and also the Apple App Store just has more stuff.<br /><br />Yes, the HD for movie viewing looks a bit sharper as what my iPad2 is able to produce but all in all the iPad is just better. Yes, more expensive but if I consider the whole family uses the iPad for hours daily investing a couple of hundred $ more just gives you the better product.<br /><br />So don't belief the advertisement from Amazon (and I am in general big fan of Amazon) but the Kindle is just not a good product and Amazon should continue doing what they are good at (selling stuff for a good price and very efficiently) and leave the tablet world to the tech guys or to the one and only - Apple.
Not a bad piece of tech, just not ready for prime time it seems.  Graphic novels fail, no fix available yet.  Panel light visible on first and second unit tried, not shipping back for third-",8,1058,"Product: Kindle Fire HD 7"", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi
Summary: Overall, the Kindle Fire HD 7"" is a solid device that caters to various features such as the ability to read numerous books, enjoy good music, movies, and games, as well as utilizing the internet for work purposes. However, it comes with its fair share of issues, such as a tricky setup, occasional crashing, and battery life falling short of expectations. 
           Customers report that it is practical, especially when traveling or on vacations, with a good display and satisfactory performance. Unfortunately, some users have encountered difficulties in configuring the device and maintaining a stable connection with Wi-Fi. Its camera quality is also viewed as underwhelming in comparison to the usual standard.
            With a mix of positive and negative views, the Kindle Fire HD 7"" seems to be a decent option for those in need of a versatile, easy-to-use tablet. However, it may not be the best choice for those expecting flawless performance and top-notch camera features.
