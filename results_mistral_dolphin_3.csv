","I ordered the google Chromecast because of the price. I have a Apple TV in my main living area and really enjoy it. I just didn't want to spend another $99 just to watch Netflix and YouTube. The Chromecast was just $29.99 with my prime membership. Shipping was fast. It arrived in 2 business days. I live in a older building and I am unable to get cable in the bedroom, so the Chromecast was the best alternative. The Setup took only a few minutes. I connected to it to my wifi I love to watch Youtube and Netflix on it. Actually Youtube shows better on the Chromecast than the Apple TV IMO. It doesn't come with a remote but I have a galaxy s4 and I use it as the remote with the watch on app. I do like that I can use my ipad and iPhone as well to control it. Overall its a great product for the money and what I use it for.
Awesome product! Simple solution to streaming content from your Mac, PC, iOS or Android device. There is the occasional lag when videos are loading. If this happens to you look up the chrome plugins you need to disable and it should fix the problem.
This one of the best purchases I have made.  I love that I can stream shows from my iphone and laptop instantly.  My only regret is not buying this sooner!
Maybe it will be better when you can use it to cast personal stuff like photos. For now, we don't have much use for it.
I'm a big Plex user.  The software update to Chromecast messed up my Plex transmission.  I wish I would have known this before I purchased it.",5,524,"Product: Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player
Summary: The Google Chromecast is a great budget alternative to more expensive streaming devices. It's easy to set up and connects to your Wi-Fi network. It works well with popular streaming services like Netflix and YouTube, and can be controlled using your smartphone or tablet. However, some users have reported occasional lag when loading videos, and compatibility issues with certain apps like Plex. Overall, it's a solid choice for those looking for an affordable streaming solution.

i love my kindle for reading, movies. My grands love  it for games and videos.  It's child friendly.  And very durable.
This is the first small tablet I have owned.  I love reading books on it.  It is small enough to carry in my purse and the white, intensity-adjustable background is just wonderful!
Love love love this kindle. This kindle delivered everything it promised and more! I own a older kindle fire and knew I needed to upgrade. I saw the HDX was on sale and started saving up for it. I am a die-hard kindle user and I am so glad I got it. When I look at movies on the kindle the picture it is just like watching my flat screen tv. If anyone is thinking about getting a tablet get the 7 HDX you won't can't go wrong and this is coming from a senior citizen.

","Easy to set up and use, love  the little cover that acts as a stand.
for the price this is the best. Big enough screen, great reader, and it has the apps I want.
Make sure you protect your contacts and files with a good virus protection package. I didn't do it right away and I did pay for it after it was too late. I managed to get rid of the virus before it created too much damage so take heed and install a virus protection app as soon as you get the chance.

","Great!
I didnt care for these personally, (they didn't fit my big earholes.<br />But, the person I gave these as a gift to, loves them a lot.<br />They rave about them.<br /><br />so I think they are ok.. just didn't fit me.
Now, these are generally OK headphones. I give them an ok cuz they generally conk out after a few months but when they work the sound quality is pretty good. Usually it's one ear or the other that will go first and then they become useless. I was mad because this particular pair I received was just broke. I plugged it into my ipod and the sound quality was in and out, garbled, you couldn't even hear the music well. So overall, when they're working they're nice but they won't last you very long.
Excellent earphones for the $$$. Long lasting. Good sound. They stay in your ear when walking.
The headphones are an amazing value, however I only received one each of the small and large ear pieces. I'm sure it was just an error in manufacturing/processing, but it was a little disappointing since the large earpieces fit me best.",5,438,"Product: Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphone
Summary: These headphones are generally well-received for their sound quality and comfort. However, some users have reported issues with durability and fit.

Fantastic game but the cardboard was ripped when I got it.
You can not go wrong with this game. Just need to get the expansion packs now. Even better to play while having a few beverages.
This is a very good party game as long as no one in the room is politically correct.  Highly recommend this game.
Purchased for my sister for Christmas!  Played it at our family Christmas dinner; it had us all in stitches!",5,331,"Product: Cards Against Humanity
Summary: Cards Against Humanity is a hilarious and dark party game that brings out the worst in your friends. It's a great icebreaker and conversation starter, but beware of overplaying it as it can wear off the novelty. The cardboard quality is questionable, but overall it's a fantastic game worth adding to your collection.

","Good battery life, bright screen.  I read in all kinds of light with no problem, love that I can carry multiple magazines and books with me at all times.  The only thing I'd change is the location of the power button (on the bottom where it gets punched off sometimes)  I can just turn the kindle upside down for most books, but magazines seem to have a permanent orientation.
I love everything about it, had the regular kindle before and it was great as well.  Love the size.  Battery life is only draw back for it.
Great product. Would recommend to anyone wanting a electronic reader. Not an Ipad but for the price great value. Get it now.
I wanted some technology to be able to enjoy some of the features others have with smartphones, but without the monthly data fees from cellular companies.  I am able to read, watch movies, check email and take advantage of Apps (my favorite right now is Words with Friends).  So far I haven't left an environment with wireless available, but most of the places I go have wireless so hopefully that won't be an issue.  Love the size of the screen and the clarity of the images and print.  Various font settings are also available.
This is an all around let down. From no bluetooth, to the weight, to the response of the touch screen, the power button, speakers, choppyness.. practically a complete failure.",5,484,"Product: Kindle Fire (Previous Generation - 1st)
Summary: The Kindle Fire (Previous Generation - 1st) is a versatile and portable electronic reader that offers a bright screen, good battery life, and the ability to read in various lighting conditions. It also allows users to access multiple magazines and books at once. However, some users have reported issues with the power button location and the touch screen responsiveness. Overall, it is a great value for the price and recommended for those looking for an electronic reader.

","It formats the exFAT and my computer will not read that format. I had to return it and order a 32gig.
working great after 1 year in Sandisk Sansa Clip+ for expanded storage
great price
I anticipate getting one of these for my Galaxy SIV; on order presently. I only wanted to 'astound' perhaps one or two reviewers with my recollection about purchasing a 1 Gig SD card from CompUSA (defunct, sadly) in their store at Dunwoody, Georgia's Perimeter Mall. This was at Christmas in 2004. I purchased the 1 Gig card for my then-groundbreaking Treo 650. The cost was $100 for the card. The Treo was purchased from Sprint PCS in Roswell, GA and it cost $650. I bought a Treo and a 1 Gig card for my girlfriend up north too as I had recently been transferred to Atlanta and I was homesick and wanted to stay in-touch via the latest technology. I still have my Treo and that pioneering (for me) 1 Gig SD card and both still work. The 1 Gig card still holds 'vintage' photos and videos of the era and I have transferred the contents innumerable times to many devices.<br /><br />In terms of size, cost and capacity I am amazed at how far things have advanced. Color me impressed with the utility of a 64 Gig Micro SD card for under one buck per gigabyte. Thank you for reading and entertaining my musings.
I purchased this disk to use in my tablet and it works very well and because it came with an adapter, I can also use it on my PC.",5,535,"Product: SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Card Plus Adapter
Summary: The SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Card Plus Adapter is a versatile and affordable storage solution for various devices.

","perfect....just what I needed!
Fantastic device. We purchased 3. The kids free time app is exactly what I needed to control the safety and appropriateness of content viewed by my 10 year old. I would like to see a few things updated such as what is unlimited and just for purchase on my wish list without having to open the book information. It would be nice to be able to just return unlimited books to the shop without checking out to get that option as we share the unlimited account and are unsure what people have finished (it would be nice to have a pop up at the last page of the book).
Without a microSD slot for additional storage, I won't be interested. I am aware that cloud storage is available, but Amazon and these other companies that produce devices with no expandable storage need to understand that WiFi is simply not as all-pervasive as they believe. In my small town, when I'm not at home or at a few commercial locations I'm off the grid and restricted to the content that can be stored on the device itself.
I love it! It's so easy to use and everything you need is at the push of a button.

Summary: The Fire HD 6 is a great tablet for kids, with a bright and clear screen and long battery life. However, some users have expressed concerns about the lack of expandable storage and the need for better control over unlimited books.

I love my new Kindle. So many things I can access. Works great!!! I just wish there was a little more music, movies and books that could be free.
I HAVE A TABLET BUT IT DOES'NT COMPARE TO MY KINDLE!!!!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!  MY GRANDKIDS LIKE PLAYING THE FREE GAMES THAT CAME ON IT
Love my Kindle!  I resisted buying one for so long because I love the feel and smell of an actual book.  But, this Kindle is super practical.  I can keep tons of books with me at all times without having to carry around the bulk and weight of actual books.  I can watch movies, use the internet, read research articles I have downloaded and even take notes on them.  It's great to carry with me on vacations when I want to be able to do things like read a few articles and check my emails for work on occasion, read on the beach or in the hotel, get some online shopping done.<br /><br />The screen resolution is great for video, but I don't really play games on it.<br /><br />The camera is not so fantastic, but then I am used to the quality of a DSLR, so most phones / tablets have cameras that I am not very impressed by.<br /><br />It's lightweight and durable, the size of a book really.
