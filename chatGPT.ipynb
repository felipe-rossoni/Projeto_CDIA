      "Summary: I bought this watch for my elderly mom and she loved it. The wide variety of materials and colors made it difficult to choose but I'm happy with the great color and dimensions of this watch. The oversize face is great and while the band is a bit stiff, I'm happy with how it looks. It's easy to read, but it does run slow and it's a bit tricky to reset the time. The indigo light is great for nighttime. However, the leather band started losing color and fading within a couple of months and getting it wet will temporarily stop it from working. Overall, it's a good and affordable watch, but think twice before buying it with a particular band.\n",

      "Summary: The Timex Women's Easy Reader watch seems to be a hit among many for its oversized face, making it easy to read even without glasses - a feature greatly appreciated especially by older folks. Its Indigo light feature also adds to the ease of reading in the dark. The watch offers a variety in band materials, colors, and sizes which gives room for personal preference. Despite its slightly heavy feel and stiff band that takes a while to soften and mold to the wrist, the aesthetic appeal of the watch still shines through. However, there are some significant drawbacks to take into consideration. The watch seems to have a reputation for running slow and the time resetting function appears a bit tricky. Attention needs to be paid to the durability of the band as well, as it may show noticeable fading after extended use. The watch also may not perform well when in contact with water.      \n",
