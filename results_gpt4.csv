","I ordered the google Chromecast because of the price. I have a Apple TV in my main living area and really enjoy it. I just didn't want to spend another $99 just to watch Netflix and YouTube. The Chromecast was just $29.99 with my prime membership. Shipping was fast. It arrived in 2 business days. I live in a older building and I am unable to get cable in the bedroom, so the Chromecast was the best alternative. The Setup took only a few minutes. I connected to it to my wifi I love to watch Youtube and Netflix on it. Actually Youtube shows better on the Chromecast than the Apple TV IMO. It doesn't come with a remote but I have a galaxy s4 and I use it as the remote with the watch on app. I do like that I can use my ipad and iPhone as well to control it. Overall its a great product for the money and what I use it for.
Awesome product! Simple solution to streaming content from your Mac, PC, iOS or Android device. There is the occasional lag when videos are loading. If this happens to you look up the chrome plugins you need to disable and it should fix the problem.
This one of the best purchases I have made.  I love that I can stream shows from my iphone and laptop instantly.  My only regret is not buying this sooner!
Maybe it will be better when you can use it to cast personal stuff like photos. For now, we don't have much use for it.
I'm a big Plex user.  The software update to Chromecast messed up my Plex transmission.  I wish I would have known this before I purchased it.
My husband love Chromecast so much he want to purchase a another, I would admits it's easier than using the laptop which have a be connected Aurum Cables 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable and PTC Mini-DVI to HDMI Adapter with 6ft HDMI Cable for Macintosh and more. So yes go ahead and buy it,  on like my hubby i'll just move the one we have from living room to bed room.
Outstanding and is everything it claims to be.  I just wish it was supported by more apps (e.g. mobile chrome, skype, hangouts, etc!).
Wow.  I'm pretty impressed by this item.  Don't forget to add 'Videostream' (by Google) to your Google Chrome account, that is so that you can stream any file on your computer/storage device to your television via the Chromecast device.  Really neat.
Sometime it hange
Somehow through all the advertisements and watercooler discussions I've had about the function of this device, I missed the fact that HDMI does not offer power...This dongle must be plugged in to function.<br /><br />I thought that it was going to RID me of a cable being a wireless receiver!<br /><br />Anyway, it's not so bad - it comes with a short USB cable, so if you have a USB input close by you can power it that way.<br /><br />Works as advertised.
This is such a great item, turned my tv into a smart tv, cheaper than buying a new smart tv.<br />set up was easy, and this can travel with you as well ! Love it !!
Decent.  Just wanted to see what it could do and for $29 it is worth it.  Somewhat limited overall but I pretty much expected it when I bought it.
Work good on my tv and phone too.
Good
Perhaps not as feature rich as other products on the market, yet I find it so easy to control the content discovery from my phone and just share it on the big screen. Once local content is enabled this device will be complete.
Ä°ts usefull.
Got a second one, not on both my TVs!
Must have for any young adult's entertainment center! It's so great for parties.
Everything was great, from the product to customer relations and delivering, it was all good. I recomend the store to anyone.
If you don't have a smart TV, well this will make it into one controlled through your Android, computer or Apple devices. Not only can you use it on almost all major platforms.<br /><br />How I use the chromecast:<br />Using it to stream Netflix Hulu YouTube Music and Google Chrome browser off my Android phone, Nexus Tablet, my laptop. I'm surprised how much I use it even though my console can do that all ready but the chromecast being controlled from my devices is a breeze to use. Can't wait til we get so much more features (like games streaming or mirroring of some sort... Google listening)<br /><br />I feel like buying a few more for more tvs around the house but I can easily move and hook it up to another TV like nothing. So when I can get more it will be for my friends and family birthdays or Christmas presents
The device worked and it worked well, so I can't say anything negative about the functionality.  Here's where it fell short of my expectations,<br /><br />1.  It can only stream Youtube and Netflix, that is, once you have started the show your tablet or phone you can have it broadcast on your TV and you can then turn off the phone or tablet if you like but the streaming will continue on your TV.  But you can't do this with anything else (Hulu, Vudu, Amazon Prime etc.).<br />2.  You can stream Amazon Prime, Hulu, Vudu etc. from your laptop using the Chrome browser but you have to keep it running on your laptop.  If you close the browser that's the end of the streaming on the TV also.  And I didn't care for it as I thought it said, anything from your computer can be watched on TV.  Technically they are correct but that's very Microsoft like and not something I'd expect from Google.  I guess once you get the taste of money, principle goes out the window.<br />3.  I have only two HDMI ports on my TV and one is being used by my Blu-ray player, the second by the set-top box (STB) and so I had to switch one of the device in and out and that was not convenient.<br />4.  I couldn't connect the Chromecast directly to the HDMI port at the back of the TV as that prevented me from connecting to the other device.  Google does provide with an extension chord that enabled me to connect the other device (Blu-ray or STB) to the TV.<br />5.  The Chromecast device by itself looks pretty cool but that's not the way it connects.  You have to be able to power it and for that you have to connect the Chromecast to the USB port at the back of the TV which my TV doesn't and for that I had to connect that to an adapter, which was connected to the power supply.  This extension is also provided by Google but it was never mentioned as such, again, they are technically correct as they do show in the demo video that you need to connect it to the USB port but as I said before, getting too technicalfor my liking.<br />6.  I'd have still made this work if the HDMI splitter, which I ordered through Amazon had worked.  The idea of switching HDMI cables in and out was not a great option for me.<br />7.  Finally, the Blu-ray device already streams Youtube and Netflix so what am I gaining by having another device that does the same as the Blu-ray.  It is true my Blu-ray does not allow me to stream anything from my computer to the TV but if I connect my computer to the TV that's also taken care of.<br /><br />In summary, if you have a Blu-ray or another device that streams Youtube and Netflix then Chromecast is not that great a buy.  But if you do not and would like to have the ability to do so then Chromecast is a great buy, it is priced right, for $35 you can't beat it.  It is possible Google will add other features to this device and then it will be a worthwhile purchase but for all the limitations that faced with this device it was not meant for me and I returned it to Amazon.
Awesome!
Purchase only if you have very good wifi connection otherwise no use
Worked for about a week and then nothing. Waste of $30!!
Great streaming device, inexpensive and pretty easy to set up on any device.
Did not work. Google support was absolutely no help. I've always been a fan of Google but was very disappointed with this product and support.
The best ever!! My life was divided in two: before and after chrome cast!'
I purchased this and didnt use it for a month.  Finally started using it for the World Cup and its a pretty amazing little device.  Now that Google is going to be adding more functionality its going to become very handy.
Nice item when used with your Chrome Browser to view internet on your Smart TV.  Love it.  You will too.
Amazing!!
Listening to music on Pandora is wonderful.  Now that Plex allows non-monthly subscribers cast content that is on their media server to Chromecast, you could send any of your movies that you have in the Plex Media Server to Chromecast.  You do still need to pay for the Plex app. It is $5 so it is fairly inexpensive for the convenience of watching your media.  It would be nice if they integrated the Chromecast feature onto the server.  This way you would not have to go to your smartphone all of the time just to play your content.<br />I am sure more apps will integrate with Chromecast, so the fun has only just begun.
This has been awesome to play Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu on our TV from our Android tablets. Also been taken on trips to play the same apps in hotels that have free Wifi.
For those without smart TVs, it's fantastic.  I plugged it into my receiver and was up in minutes.  I have decent wifi and I've never had an issue.  I was finally able to get the Wii out of the livingroom and put it in my daughter's room to watch Netflix.
I don't know what kind of wifi router and devices you need to decently stream from a laptop, but definitely the RT-AC66U and a retina 13&#34; early 2k14 macbook pro won't do.<br /><br />My 2014 edition samsung note 10.1&#34; had a few hangups here and there on YouTube.<br /><br />While this may sound like an apple fanboy thing, I can assure you it's not: I got used to the Apple TV not having much trouble streaming my laptop's screen outside of the .6 to .8 second delay. That delay makes it almost impossible to hit a specific, small portion of your screen with your cursor, if you're just looking at the TV. Maybe Chromecast 2 can do better? If the Apple TV can, the technology is already on the market, Google just has to use it.<br /><br />Overall a great idea, and definitely priced right, however, you're not going to get great use out of this, even if you're rolling on a gigabit wifi.
There's far better options out there.  Do you really want to use your phone as a remote?  Ask yourself that first before buying this solely because it is stupidly cheap.
I bought a bunch of these for my family, and they all like them and use them, and only one family member needed help setting it up. :)
Like many of the other reviewers, I picked up this device when Google announced it a few months ago since they were bundling a few months of Netflix with it (making the actual device cost more like...$10).<br /><br />The device is astonishingly simple. It's no bigger than an over sized flash drive, has a male HDMI connector, reset button, and micro-usb connector. The micro-usb is for power since the current HDMI standard doesn't support power applications (even though it is capable). You can either plug it into the wall or plug it into your TV if you have a TV with a USB port (like many HDMI equipped HDTVs made in the past decade).<br /><br />To reiterate to many, this isn't a typical &#34;local content&#34; kind of device. It's a streaming device that is told where to get its content from via another device. There is no interface, no channels, nothing (well, there is a &#34;splash screen&#34; that tells you its name and what WiFi network it is connected to). So if you have Netflix running on your phone and stream to Chromecast, your phone just told the Chromecast where to get the video stream, the CC connects to it, displays it, and your phone is now free to do whatever it wants (even turn off if you so choose). There are pros and cons to all of this.<br /><br />Now as of December 2013, the application PLEX now supports Chromecast (only if you're subscribed to the Plex Pass though seeing as it's only in alpha/beta releases). This was done because of all of the people who wanted a way to play their local content and I have to say, it works amazingly well. You simply install your PLEX Server on whatever desktop or laptop that has your media, pull up the PLEX App (phone, web browser, etc.), select your content, and then beam it to your Chromecast. What's great about this is that PLEX will transcode through it's own cloud and makes your entire library available through their cloud (so you don't need to worry about network shares, security, ssh, etc.). In summary, you can bring your Chromecast wherever you want, plug it in, go through the setup, and then have access to your media server on the go. I travel a decent bit and it's nice to be able to throw it in my suitcase, hook it up to a hotel's WiFi network and play videos off my NAS back home.<br /><br />As for the set up, it's really simple. You install the Chromecast app on your phone/tablet and it does a step-by-step walk through and will have you up and running in a few minutes.<br /><br />And as for one last perk, it supports HDMI-CEC. What this means is that when you go to use it, it will change your TV's input (assuming you have a TV that supports it...which is most that have an HDMI port) to the input of the active device (your Chromecast in this case). Albeit you'll need to switch back to your regular TV input if you watch cable or play games, but it definitely does a good job at trying to get content to your big screen in as few taps, clicks, and swipes as possible.
I bought this because I have a TV in my bedroom that isn't a smart TV and a bluray player that doesn't have built in wifi, and I wanted to be able to watch Netflix in that room. For that purpose, Chromecast is excellent. Set up was easy, and it streams Netflix flawlessly. I've also used it to play YouTube videos on the TV and that also works very well. My only complaint is that it can't do more. For example, I'd like to be able to use my Amazon Prime account and stream videos from that like I can on my smart TV downstairs. I know google is adding more features and as they do, I may upgrade this to a 5 star. It does what it does very well, but loses one star because I wish it could do more. For the price though, it works well and I would recommend it to others.
Makes streaming from your computer or phone a breeze. Sets up in ten min or less and is very intuitive in use. Love it.
This is just one of those gadgets you need to have.  The picture and 5.1 sound are excellent with it plugged into a home theater HDMI port.  The set up was easy, and to control it with a phone is just hard to appreciate without actually seeing it work.  Then we moved it to a second TV, and used it through that TV's speakers.  Flawless with no additional setup required..  I paid $35 for it, and it was worth it.  I've seen it advertised now for $29.99.  If you have a TV with an open HDMI port, spend the money. The cool factor alone is worth it. Oh, and it broadcasts Netflix really well as a bonus...
must have product, like it.
Its good for those who watches  you tube and  Netflix.  I want to see my photos but I can not. I think its difficult or I don't know how to. But its not  even addressed any where if it could. wast of money looks like.Not for Apple users.
Chromecast makes streaming video much more convenient than using the built in apps on my TV. I can use my phone or tablet to browse and cat videos instead of using the TV remote.
Google Chromecast will NOT work with Microsoft Surface RT Tablets.  There are NO apps available in order for the tablet to work with the Chromecast.<br /><br />Will return the product.  Either Google or Microsoft must create an app for this product to work.
The Chromecast has been a very welcome to my household which consists of me and two roommates.  Each of us has a smartphone and whenever we want to listen to music in the living room, any one of us can just start up Pandora on our phone and cast it to the TV.  The Youtube functionality is pretty neat too: when multiple people are selecting videos on their phones, they enter into a shared queue for the device.  So far, that's all we use it for, but the device is so inexpensive that it was already worth it.  I'm excited for other apps to support or get built for the Chromecast.
Easy to install and functional
Working great on my Sansung note tablet, watching Netflix movies on my TV.
Love love love this!! My family and I watch movies all the time! I bought two for my house, and I'm buying one for my mom, and my daughter...
I liked the device when I first got it. Now it won't recognize my WiFi. The only way I can get it to work is to take it to the default settings and reinstall it. Then it only works for one session. I am using an iPad.
I would recommend this product to anyone. The instructions for setup were clear and easy to follow. My family and I have used this device almost every day since we purchased it and it has not given us any issues.
I hate the Chromecast. It is the worst purchase I have ever made. First complaint is that when I turn the TV off then turn it back on the picture does not appear, but the sound does work. The second complaint is that after using it for 2 weeks the chromecast is not recognized on my wifi. I don't know why this is happening but I do not want this thing anymore.
Nice little gimmick to display your browser on your screen. It can do full screen of your desktop with the correct software hack. Hopefully they will release a developer kit soon that allows apps to be installed and run.
All I can say is amazing! You can move it from tv to tv and place to place quickly and easy! Plus the price is awesome
Easy to setup - ALMOST. During synch process I got an error message. It re- synced and the error message reappeared. Apparently my Netgear R6300 needs to be modified to work with Chromecast (along with a slew of other routers). When I went to my router I could not figure out how to modify it at all. Net gear c/s was non-existent so Chromecast now only acts as a wallpaper for my 55 inch TV. I will buy Apple TV as I know it will work. Waste of time & money.<br /><br />Bernie Ness<br />Toledo, OH
Works with youtube music, Netflix, HBO GO, new AC routers need to be configured to allow Chromecast to work..... Plays full HD video with ease.....
It works as expected. I use it mostly for HBOgo, ESPN, Netflix, and now Showtime Anytime. It's easy to cast from your phone on to the TV.
One of the best things that I have ever purchased, with a very low cost you can convert your regular TV  into smart one. I can use my phone to cast YouTube videos and watch them. It is perfect and very easy to install.
Why doesn't anyone tell us this stuff? Chromecast will not access my network (Comcast Business), neither will it access my backup MiFi network. Apparently it has problems with numerous routers and networks. Google help is none existent. Once you own one of these you find the forums are full of similarly disappointed customers. Who has the time to waste?    My 2 Rokus work just fine and I hope my new Amazon Fire dongle works well when I get it. But this Chromecast was a distinct shock to the system. I truly thought technology had moved on from this sort of experience. Simply awful. And very disappointing. I really wanted it to work!    I am not returning it - I learnt from the forums that it will work with Verizon Fios (fingers crossed) - I do have someone in mind -  a surprise present for Christmas!    LATEST FROM COMCAST, JUST FOUND IT:  Re: Chromecast with Cisco DPC3939B Router  â08-19-2014 10:51 AM    At this time the Cisco 3939B is not compatible with Chromecast. Our senior engineering team is working with Cisco to resolved this issue, and a fix will be in place with the next firmware update. We will post an update once the new firmware is released.     Sorry for any incovenience at this time.
I have had for about a week and am very pleased at how easy it was to set up and how well casting from a tab is working. I have a Roku for amazon prime, but when I saw this I thought for the price it was worth trying so that I could watch website videos on my TV. For example my husband and I like to watch live worship services from several churches, and it is hard for both of us to watch the smaller computer screen. The Chromecast works without a problem so far and I am very pleased with it!!!
This little device, is great for what it does, but 2 cons:<br /><br />- The lack of services<br />- You can only use it in the U.S. (in my case, i have to pay for a VPN so i can use it, even with youtube)
For a beta item it works pretty well. Still think they rushed it to market. Cmon, beta Google? Then give it away... We are not your testers. Pay someone to do that and release a solid product if your going to charge for it. I really do not care what you paid to manufacturer it in comparison with what I paid..... I have dealt with you since your inception and you have always been some cheap (#$holes.
Honestly, I doubted a lot before buying the Chromecast, but now that I have one, is really fun, I watch YouTube videos, series and more, in my TV, just using my smartphone or tablet as a &#34;content chooser&#34;. I really recommend this product, it worth the 35 bucks.
Works great but has very few options to stream video to tv.  I can not stream videos from my Amazon Prime or any of my personal videos or photos.  The technology is more than capable but it is another example of tablet users losing out to manufacturers trying to limit any other tablets from using their technology.  Someday developers we just agree on a standard that all tablets can utilize.  I hate to see technology held back over these issues.
I bought this because I thought it can mirror anything from my iPad or my desktop, but it only mirror content from YouTube and Netflix.  It doesn't mirror that well for some website content.  But it's kind of cool that you can mirror video from iPhone through You Tube.
Chromecast installs in minutes.  Its simple design makes it a must have for watching Netflix, Youtube, etc. on your TV.
Excellent alternative to AppleTV and the other more expensive media streamers.
For what its purpose is, you just can't beat the value.  Impulse buy by a long shot.  Be sure to have a good router to support the best possible 2.4ghz speed if you play on using HD streaming.
Works perfectly!
Awesome product for the price.  If anyone asks me if they should get a smart TV I always tell them NO.  Just get an average TV and then buy this Chromecast unit.  Now you have a smart TV at a great price with more potential.
What gives Amazon? If you'd write an app for this like Netflix, I could finally watch my instant video on my television.","Product: Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player 

Summary: Overall, the Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player was well received by customers. They praised its affordability and ease of use, saying it was an efficient way to transform an ordinary television into a 'smart TV'. However, it is a common sentiment that the product's streaming capabilities need expansion as it primarily only supports YouTube and Netflix. Some users experienced issues with internet connectivity and device compatibility, suggesting that the Google Chromecast does not always function optimally with all networks or devices. Despite these drawbacks, users are fans of its compact size and mobility, praising it for its capacity to be used in different rooms and on various TV sets. Many users also conveyed a desire for more apps to be compatible with the device.

","I've really enjoyed my kindle fire hdx from listening to music to reading, or just playing apps.  it's small light you can take it pretty much anywhere and it has a good battery life.
i love my kindle for reading, movies. My grands love  it for games and videos.  It's child friendly.  And very durable.
This is the first small tablet I have owned.  I love reading books on it.  It is small enough to carry in my purse and the white, intensity-adjustable background is just wonderful!
Love love love this kindle. This kindle delivered everything it promised and more! I own a older kindle fire and knew I needed to upgrade. I saw the HDX was on sale and started saving up for it. I am a die-hard kindle user and I am so glad I got it. When I look at movies on the kindle the picture it is just like watching my flat screen tv. If anyone is thinking about getting a tablet get the 7 HDX you won't can't go wrong and this is coming from a senior citizen.
I ordered on Tuesday and it was at my door Wednesday. Now all I have to do is learn how great it is. My wife has one and her's is great.
, it just has so many things that I will need help with.  I WILL  use the website and maybe  my niece who also has one.
love it, just wish it had a light to show that it is charging...other wise I really like it.
I love my Kindle fires. I'd give this one 5 stars of it had a front facing camera. My only complaint!
OK, I can't delete my review so blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blahblah blah blahblah blah blahblah blah blah.
I love it and have zero regrets in buying it.I would hightly recommend it to a friend.Absolutely beautiful look and style.
Gave this as a gift to my mother , she loves it.
Responded quickly to arrival of damaged kindle fire and sent replacement. I'm still learning to use the features. Not intuitive to older person.
I just received the Kindle for my christmas from my son-in-law and I love it so much I on it every night
I would have given it a five star but you can't get histogram on here that sucks
Got the Kindle hd  to upgrade/replace the kindle fire that has problems with the charger port..  The customer service seems good,  but I regret the many hours I spend trying to remedy what I now know to be a common problem with the Kindle HD-  wifi connection problems .  My original Kindle Fire gets the wifi signal both Kindle HD are missing.<br /><br />Amazon- this is a time killer for all involved. Please build these devices right in the first place.<br /><br />On the other hand... Maybe my router was a bit overtaxed.  Thankyou customer support for your patience and efficient assistance!
Arrived faster then expected.  Packaging superior.  Works great so far.  No problems.
I love the Kindle Fire HDX.  It is fabulous.  :-)
Absolutely love it! A perfect compromise between my iPad4 and phablet.
Unless you know how not to get the request for turning on &#34;location based services&#34; or you just don't care to have an Amazon billboard that you had to pay for, I would not recommend a new Kindle for you. The request comes on continuously and stops whatever you are doing. Makes using more aggravation than worthwhile. I recommend I Pad
There are times when I try to start a site and it shows image with arrow .I tap and it goes black.I need to go to silk browser<br />And write in what I want to see.example: Tracy Chapman sings 'stand by me ' on David Letterman.<br />..
Love it
Love ok it!
Love
I spent months reviewing and comparing tablets, and as an avid Amazon-user I thought I had made a well informed choice. Wrong. This tablet honestly stinks. The technology seems half-baked. Some of the programs work flawlessly while others are glitchy and frustrating. For example, I can't even access the app store but the silk internet browser works fine! The app store half loads, and none of the links even work. It's definitely not my internet connection, because all of my other devices are running flawlessly. I read a bunch of blogs and tried doing a few things (resetting time/date settings, restarting the kindle, checking internet settings...) I am just so disappointed. As a Mac user, I probably should have shelled out the extra cash and went with the iPad. I am returning this tablet after only one day. Even worse, the Mayday button won't connect me to customer service! It just loads for a while and then reports an error in connection. A rare miss for my Amazon experience.
Absolutely love it
I, have the Kindle fire  the Kindle fire HDX 8.9  and this Kindle fire HDX 7 as well as the IPAD  They all serve different situations.  I find the Kindle fire hdx7 to be my most carried device  It is light weight and the picture quality is great  cons  It do not have all my music,  I cant seem to get the app TuneSync Lite to transfer my music,  It is great for my movies
Love love love it.
I like it a lot because it dose a little more than the HD . Just a little disappointed that it doesn't take  pictures
Excellent Item.  Bought it as a Christmas gift for someone I love and they absolutely LOVED it.  I was impressed with the capabilities and the functionality of it.  It really is a great item to have, whether it's for personal use or as a gift.
I was looking at the hdx 7 even before christmas and never saw or I might have missed the part with the camera specification. I like taking pictures of my bulldog and with just a front facing camera I can't do it. I would give it a 5 if there is another camera. Overall the processor is awesome!! I will recommend it for those who only wanted to take a selfie for the camera part.
I love the size, quality and everything about my new Kindle Fire HDX.  It is great on trips, I can watch movies in flight, read my favorite books and magazines and keep updated on facebook and email when I travel.
Cloud storage should be run with 100% renewable energy. This device does not meet this criteria, not even close, it is therefore going to contribute to massive increases in global warming and pollution through the burning of fossil fuels.<br />For the sake of our planet and our children I would not recommend this gadget! Shame on you Amazon, shame on you for being so irreverently irresponsible. Shape up and right your wrongs or you will continue to lose customer support. For anyone reading this, Apple uses renewable energy to run their cloud storage, go support them and DO NOT SUPPORT AMAZON.
A little disappointed, because I absolutely love playing Hayday and I can't get it on this.  Hubby bought me this for Christmas, like it except not being able to play favorite game
Love my Kindle, just didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to download Google based apps like Youtube, etc. They have youtube viewer apps but don't work like I would hope and I just end up going to the website.  Love having Amazon Prime and the Kindle Overall, just wish certain apps were universal!
I give it 5 stars because it's just amazing. I love it to death!! LOVE the camera, sound, and look! Have no problem with it at all!  I previously owned an older version of The Kindle Fire, and you can tell the difference. 10/10 would recommend to buy it.
Have problems because it doesn't have as much apps as I was hoping it would . With Skype it does not let you use the emoticons . And on PayPal the keyboard will not come up . And getting this for a Christmas gift<br />I wanted to play Hay Day and it does not have that app and so I needed to contact Mayday and they finally got it on the Kindle<br />.<br />.
I really wish this device had  a two way camera and a way to personalize it with a wallpaper of my choice. Other than that I love it.
Returned.  Could not figure it out and you cant get a lot of apps.  Sticking with Ipad.
LOVE IT!
I was so looking forward to getting the new Fire.  I use the speech to text feature a lot, and the design for that is extremely poor.  The slide bar to move you to another position in the book is just below the on/off toggle.  (Hope I am explaining this well enough.)  When you turn the speech feature on & off, you have to be EXTREMELY careful not to touch the slide bar, or you lose your place in the book.  It's driving me nuts & I often go back to my old Kindle Touch.  It works great on that discontinued Kindle.
I bought this for a friend who has really gotten into the use of Tablets. He had an iPad but was curious about my continued fascination with the Kindle as I had the original Kindle Fire, the HD and now the HDX (all of which I am still using).<br /><br />Well, now he knows why. (And a complete no-brainer if you compare the HDX and the other popular one, really.)<br /><br />He loves the Kindle HDX and has completely switched to using it. The portability factor alone (which was my main deal) was a huge plus. He has loaded lots of books on his reading list into it. The clarity of the movies he watches is greatly enhanced (according to him). The ease of downloading everything he wants into it has made him ecstatic as he is a total film buff and the memory capacity of the HDX is greatly increased compared to the iPad price ratio.
Beautiful tablet; great visual experience; almost as fast as my PC on the internet; downside: cannot use Google Android apps--many of which I came to depend on.
I am having problems with it freezing up.  I have to let the battery die before I can restart it.
This is my 4th Kindle.  Love the kindle products.
Best tablet I have played with ever. I thought I liked the paper white more because of the screen but you really do get used to this screen. It doesn't hurt your eyes and now I can't go back to the paper white.
Best small computer tablet ever. Downloaded gaming apps and don't see it anymore since Mom and Brother share it. Pleased it gets emails, web searches, TV viewing and games. Battery life is only 5-7hr but uses sound so may last longer on lower output. May have to purchase another for me to use as it's always shared by family member and I must use PC laptop. For the price it is outstanding.
I've owned two other Kindles before and absolutely loved them.  This one disappoints me though.  I bought it at Best Buy and returned it about four weeks later because the screen dims even when it's on automatic brightness.  Very frustrating.  So they gave me another one and it does the same thing.  I even called and talked to a Kindle tech about the problem and she tried to help me but it's still doing the same thing.  Best Buy told me they wouldn't accept a return on the second one because it would be past the return date.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this one compared to the Kindle Fire HD.
I love my kindle
So far I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire.  It does everything I want it to do.  The only thing that I find odd is that although it has a camera to take pictures, you can only take Selfies.  You cannot turn the tablet around and take a picture like a camera.  I find that strange but other than that I'm very happy and would recommend the purchase.
Who doesn't love the kindle fire?
Sturdy little tablet. I like fire os. Battery life is excellent
I wouldn't buy this if I had to to do over. The app store is horrible. They say that you can download Google play apps but you have to jump through hoops to do so. The notification of emails is the only thing you seen to get so far. The device itself is nice but when you use to having good app selection it makes it not worth it. Maybe it would be better if you get all the Amazon devices but then you might as well just get an iPad or something else with that money. Best of luck with your purchase  Also the keyboard sucks. Swype rarely works. The longer I have this the more I don't like it.
This is my go to device for getting information on anything.  Unlike my phone... it is easy to use and straight forward.
Love it.
we got this for our son - like the feature where you can limit the amount of time they play games - reading time is unlimited.
I love it
this great, I love it
I am very happy with my kindle doe more than i know how to make it do last a long time and keeps me occupied as it should would buy it again.
I absolutely love my Kindle!
I expected more from this &#34;tablet&#34;. It is bascially a marketing device for Amazon.  The Silk browser works fast enough but I have consistent issues when trying to view an image from any web site. Messed with the setting and that did not help. I will use it until it burns out. I should have gone with another Android tablet, downloaded the free Kindle Book apps and worked from there. I will use it for e-mail, some games, and use the browser when no other option is available.
Great, everything was as it said it would be. Thanks.
It is easy to use; light enough to hold for 30 minutes or more without causing pain or fatigue. images are very clear and most of all the battery life is excellent. I have used it everyday for last three weeks.
It's a bit lighter than the previous versions. I don't like the ad feed on the startup page I haven't found a way to turn it off.
I love This it's. Awesome!
I had the original Kindle Fire which was just ok, but this new edition is great and I love it, especially when I travel.  It's so lightweight and easy to carry in my bag...
I really like the HDX,,all the fuss about the blue around the edge of the screen is crazy.You really have to look for it on a pure white screen to even notice it.I really don't understand what people want for a 200$ tablet,,I have a full size Ipad and sure it works like silk and is perfect but it also cost me 599$.I love this small tablet,I take it everwhere with me.If you are looking for a small tablet with the fastest processor out there and one of the best displays,,BUY THIS<br />This is an update for the HDX,,,used it now for almost a month and I still love it.I also own a Nexus 7 2013 and the HDX beats it hands down,,Stuff to know,,the nexus 7 is about an inch and a half longer making it feel very big compared to the kindle..reviewers complain about the kindle being difficult to use do not want to try the nexus,,there are no directions at all in the pack and there is no help to call like the kindle.I have them both in a I blason cover which I can say is a very nice cover for both of them for the price.Performance wise the kindle and the nexus are close,both have beautiful screens,,but I have to say that the kindle has better sound.To let you know I only bought the nexus so I can use the google play store,,but have to say I still love the kindle,,and I am  still trying to see the blue edges after a month of use.I either got a very good kindle because its barely there after looking really hard to see it
Works well, and can get Amazon instant video right on it.
The KINDLE FIRE HDX!! 32-Gig...works, flawlessly!!<br />It is twice as fast as the previous Generation.<br />LOVE IT...!!! Highly recommend it!!
I love it for playing my games, reading, watching shows, e-mails and much much more!
This is my third Kindle.  I almost talked myself out of upgrading from my original Kindle Fire (didn't really &#34;need&#34; it).  I'm glad I didn't.  The speed and visual graphics of this edition are outstanding.  My laptop is feeling neglected!  I use the Fire HDX everyday. From gaming to surfing the web to watching HD movies it has not disappointed.  Would highly recommend it.","Product: Kindle Fire HDX 7"", HDX Display (Previous Generation - 3rd)
Summary: Most reviews of the Kindle Fire HDX are positively beaming. This nifty little tablet is loved for its lightweight design, great battery life, and crystal-clear HDX display that makes reading, watching movies, and playing games a joy. Users also appreciate its kid-friendly features and durability, making it perfect for family use. The Kindle Fire HDX also shines in the versatility department, as it's compact enough to be carried around in a purse and ideal for travel. However, there are a few shortfalls. Some users wish it had a two-way camera, a light to show that it's charging, and that it supported Google-based apps. Some senior citizens mentioned struggling to learn how to use its features. A glaring common complaint centers around Wi-Fi connection problems, which some users spent hours trying to remedy. Lastly, there were criticisms for the lack of environmental consideration in the product's energy sourcing for cloud storage.

","Easy to set up and use, love  the little cover that acts as a stand.
for the price this is the best. Big enough screen, great reader, and it has the apps I want.
Make sure you protect your contacts and files with a good virus protection package. I didn't do it right away and I did pay for it after it was too late. I managed to get rid of the virus before it created too much damage so take heed and install a virus protection app as soon as you get the chance.
Nice
So far, I LOVE IT.  It is small, fast, and exactly what I was looking for. I got the Citron color and I love it!
It is amazing
This newest version is not as good as the previous kindle fire I own. About half of the time I try to swop the screen to open it, the screen come back blank. I have to reboot the kindle just to get it working again. It's extremely frustrating.
WONDERFUL! One of the best purchases I have made in awhile !
This is my second kindle. Bought because of front and back camera, lighter in weight.  The on off button is  too small.
I've had more trouble with downloading apps I bought a game and it wouldn't download it's on my carousel but won't open , I can't get rid of SMS, I've got another game that wasn't transferred and to my new kindle, went to chat on Amazon and got nowhere,not to happy right now.
awesome product my wife loves it
My Mom bought 2 of these for my boys (7&5). They love them! I like that they can both be registered to me but each of the kids have their own profile on them. The profiles are geared towards their age and I can monitor the content they download and set time limits on them.
Nice little tablet.  Still cant get the mobile app for money network debit card though.  That would be nice.
Love my fire! So handy and convenient. Perfect size, wonderful display, good speakers/camera. Love being able to read as much as I want with kindle unlimited and kindle first. I just love this tablet
Got it for my grandson and he loves it.
Bought this for working trip to Australia.  Wide range of functions for very reasonable price.  You can spend more for a higher-def display, but at this size I can't really see the difference.  Video playback is also crisp.  Huge range of functions, both built in and downloadable Android apps; haven't had any of the latter fail despite what I understand to be enhancement Amazon made to the OS.  The size is the most persuasive feature--fits in coat pocket (not in jeans, however), and I was able to shlep it and the keyboard all over Australia without difficulty (the keyboard, which I got separately, is adequate for email, and possibly for more extended work once you get used to the placement of things like semicolons, which are not where your fingers expect them to be; it's a significantly bigger form factor than the Fire itself, but thin and lightweight.  Spending more for the 16 GB made sense for me--I was able to download 4 feature films for those long air flights and still have plenty of room for music, books, etc.  One odd note considering the Fire's heritage--I still prefer my paperwhite for plain old reading.  But I don't think anyone will be dissatisfied with the Fire on that count either.  So it's basically a home run.
My old Fire tablet was really great but I truly love my new tablet. It is faster, clearer has many new and improved features  which just adds to the enjoyment of using my tablet.<br /><br />I highly recommend the new Fire tablet.
I love everything about my kindle fire! The only thing I have a complaint about is the camera. My iPhone takes better quality pictures but the kindle fire isn't awful. The speakers are awesome, the picture on movies is like watching right from the tv and reading on it is a breeze. I HIGHLY recommend.
VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!
Excellent buy. Does most of what my IPad can do.
It is a great price and is suited to my needs. Two thumbs up!!
I got a Kindle Fire 1st generation for Christmas when they first came out. I just got the new Fire HD 7 this past Christmas and I can't believe the difference. The picture and sound quality are so much better compared to my old Kindle Fire. I have been watching movies and TV shows on it daily.
Don't understand everything yet but I love being able to check email from my chair. I am disabled
Love it. Will use it often because it is smaller than my tablet it will fit in my purse.
This is the first Kindle I have owned.  It was very easy to navigate and start using.  I am very pleased with it!
I will never buy another amazon tablet device again. These turds have not only disabled our choices in terms of modifying the way that we want to see our interface, they have blocked us from using interactive devices that would, in every other circumstance (using alternative hardware), provide valuable services. In short, DO NOT BUY and amazon device unless you crave to be tyrannically stripped of your choices regarding software.
I LOVE MY FIRE HD7  DIDNT GET HUGH DONT WANT IT
Very fun!
Perfect for the $!
A smart purchase. A viable substitute for an iPAD, at an excellent price point.
I love my Kindle Fire, but the charger I can't use but for a couple minutes at a time because it gets so hot it can't be touched...Not sure how to get this replaced, but guess I will figure it out.  So I contacted Amazon tech support and they are sending me a replacement part...VERY HAPPY with results
Overall, good tablet. Was expecting something bigger. Ordered online
Exactly what I was looking for! Beautiful crisp resolution. No lag in selecting icons or navigating. This is my third tablet purchase and am definitely satisfied based on price and quality. Would recommend!
easy to use and really appreciated that the material that I had on my other Kindle transferred over without any problems
The changes in the reader part was most disappointing. Missing the old book shelf.
There are just a few apps and things that I wish the kindle could do.  I want it to be an iPad!  But this is for sure the next best thing!  I LOVE free time and that it functions like an apple product as all of my other devices are made by Apple.  I also like the general display and ease between screens.  It's a great product!
I really haven't had a chance to get all the way acquainted with it yet, but what I did, I liked.
I was disappointed every thing from &#34;Patsy 3&#34; did not transfer to the new one. My books did and that was most important. I call and did not get the usual good service.  I couldn't understand her.
So much power in such a small package!
I loved my first kindle fire but my kindle HD is great!!
Great buy...
I was really disappointed with this product. It works fine but I am a WordSearchBible user.  And in fact the reason I purchased the Fire HD was because of my desire to use it with WordSearchBible.  I am quite disappointed to discover that the two don't communicate and I have lost my money on this thing.
To many ads come up, but reads really well and very clear.
I bought two for my twins 6th birthday. There good for them. Bluetooth doesn't connect to my Samsung note 3. The battery takes quite awhile to charge which wouldn't bother me if the battery didn't die sooo fast. I do like that they feel more heavy and durable for kids. But I don't like all the advertisements.. which I think might be my fault for buying with special offer for it to be cheaper. But it didn't specify what the special offer was.. so my bad. If I had known I would have paid the extra 20.00+ dollars or whatever it was
As advertised
great deal
Love it.  Only wish i could use it outdoors.
So slow vs mini ipad
Love it
I've o only had this for a week, but I absolutely love it! I bought it for grad school to use for my textbooks mostly while it was on sale for $99, and so far I'm very pleased. I would recommend the fire hd 7 to anyone looking for a tablet and ereader all in one. :) Great product, great price.
I received a defective one, it was a Christmas present to my daughter and it will be a month before she gets her new one. I understand these things happen but replacement time is way too long.
Perfect for my little reader.
Does what I need it to do and does it well at a good price.
I would have given it 5 but when all of our other devices are working fine, my kindle won't connect to the wi-fi sometimes. I have to turn it off and back on and it will work great for a while. Other than that it's great! It's a perfect size and I love the color!!
this is my 2nd hd7 the 1st had trouble after a month I hope last longer I really like the device
Love this tablet!! Exactly what I wanted and meets my expectations.
Love it.
Awesome for the price
Very nice product, has worked out very well. This item will get a lot of play time
It's Amazing! There's nothing I would change about it :)
i like it but battery life drains faster than i thought
Nice but wrong one
Love it.
I'm on it now, writing this review and it's great. I love it! Great product, great price, fast shipping!
I would like the option of desk top display instead of the carousel
I'm a book person but I'm slowly coming around. I could have bought a smaller  model but went ahead and went for the Fire HD. I really like it a lot.
Don't! The original kindle fire has more storage. I have about 1/3 of my books on this new kindle and get a low storage warning when downloading the music on old kindle. This a replacement for the first one of these I bought. it is just not worth it. what a pain!
Great stand
This works just as I expected.  It is fast and, easy to view.
This is a terrific tablet.","Product: Fire HD 7, 7"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB
Summary: The Fire HD 7 brings a generally positive response from users, particularly due to the device's affordability. Users rave about the tablet's easiness to use and set up along with its perfect size as a portable gadget. They also appreciate its HD display, fast performance, and ample storage space. The addition of protective covers that doubles as a stand is seen as a plus by many. While it is lauded for its reading capabilities, some users have found issues with the device's interface, downloading apps, and some limitations of functions compared to other devices. The product's battery life and charger have received criticism for heating up quickly or draining faster than anticipated. A small number of users encountered issues with Wi-Fi connection and a few have reported receiving defective items. Meanwhile, many users recommend investing in a reliable virus protection package for the tablet.

","Great!
I didnt care for these personally, (they didn't fit my big earholes.<br />But, the person I gave these as a gift to, loves them a lot.<br />They rave about them.<br /><br />so I think they are ok.. just didn't fit me.
Now, these are generally OK headphones. I give them an ok cuz they generally conk out after a few months but when they work the sound quality is pretty good. Usually it's one ear or the other that will go first and then they become useless. I was mad because this particular pair I received was just broke. I plugged it into my ipod and the sound quality was in and out, garbled, you couldn't even hear the music well. So overall, when they're working they're nice but they won't last you very long.
Excellent earphones for the $$$. Long lasting. Good sound. They stay in your ear when walking.
The headphones are an amazing value, however I only received one each of the small and large ear pieces. I'm sure it was just an error in manufacturing/processing, but it was a little disappointing since the large earpieces fit me best.
Didn't expect such sound quality with such cheap price
I have a super difficult time finding earphones that fit and stay in place while I am running. I have tried them all, even the Yurbuds that claim to stay in place no matter what! These little gems are puuurrrrrfect! SO glad I bought them...am buying more to stock up just in case they stop making them for some strange reason!
Excellent
This is the only style of ear plugs I can use.  I use them at night to mute the TV so my husband can sleep.  They work perfectly.
These are my first headphones of any type. I purchased mainly to use with my cellphone and am more than satisfied with this purchase:<br />The material the ear buds are made of makes it easy to grasp to fit in my ears.<br />The buds fit nice and snug, are comfortable and adjustable.<br />Sound is clear and the microphone is easy to use.<br /><br />The purple color makes it easy to find in my car (car has black interior which seems to swallow any black object that I'm not holding) and doesn't disappear into the dark depth of any handbag I'm using. Always a plus.
These are an every day use for me. They have quite a balanced range other than true deep bass, but you won't get that on in ear monitors anyways.
I've bought so many of these and they are excellent. Sound is awesome and price is too!
Owned these earphones for 3 months so far.. Im amazed how great they sound for the price and lasting they are. Definately a great steal, i would pay $20 for these thats how great the sound is.
Broke after a few days.
good product
The old ones I had that I bought literally years ago lasted up till a few weeks ago so I ordered a new pair. Unfortunately, I did notice that the insulation over the wire (or maybe it's the wire itself) is thinner than my old ones. When I first took it out of the packaging I noticed that the wires felt a bit fragile. Common sense tells me that this will effect the earbuds' longevity, but I'll have to edit my review later to see how long they'll last.  Sound quality is so-so, but for the price, they're not bad at all.
these headphones are great they sound great they fit great and they are a great price
These are the best earbuds I've ever owned! I can't get them to work with my iPhone 5S, however. Thought I'd mention that in case anyone came looking.
Very good! Thanks!
I've always equated Panasonic with a certain level of quality, but now I am revising that status.  I won't use technical terms to describe the quality of sound because even talk radio doesn't sound good.  The sound is thin and treble-y -- like a cheap 1960's transistor radio.  I've bought earbuds costing the same and even less(in an emergency, at a gas station!) that sounded infinitely better (0 * anything is infinitely better).<br /><br />I am so disappointed with this purchase.  I bought these because I've purchased Skull Candy earbuds that were over-hyped and under-performing and I paid too much attention to the high-star reviews.  Now I'm not sure what to buy.  I have an old pair of Philips that I return to again and again, but those are not getting plaudits in my price range these days.<br /><br />Good luck, everyone.  Don't buy these and let me know if you find a good pair of earbuds!
I have reviewed earbuds before on Amazon and really liked the kind I had been using, but needed a back-up pair for work and picked these up because they were a good deal. These have taken over the number one spot and I now order them over and over. They are very durable, but I am exceptionally hard on earbuds, hence the many orders.( I shut them in car doors accidentally and then drive home with them hanging out the door, for example.) The reason these are my go to buds is the comfort level. They do not irritate my ears or make them hurt like most earbuds do and they stay in exceptionally well. I work in an office where I have to have something to block out the noise so I can concentrate and I have them in four hours at a time, take a break, put them back in and go the rest of the day without any problem.
ok headphones but I don't like them as they will not work with any i phone cover even ones that have lots of room.
Fit very comfortably and snug (do not fall out!). Love the feel, the wire is a bit flimsy, but hey, for $6.50 with shipping, who can complain?!<br /><br />Incredible for the price! No regrets.
Amending my review from 5 stars to 2 because these broke within 4 months of my purchase. They sounded great, and I used them pretty much daily, but is $8 worth 4 months of use? Maybe so, maybe not.<br /><br />Note, they didn't break from any particular event like being stepped on or dropped. I merely took one of the buds out of my ear and it separated from the rest of the product.
FLOORED...I was floored when I heard how great the sound was from these ear buds compared to the price paid for them.  I actually ended up getting everyone I knew a pair...well family and close friends...more than 20 since buying this set.  The bass is on par with some over the ear headphones and sound is clean and clear. I use them on my Samsung Galaxy Tab and really couldn't have found a better set of headphones. I paired these and the TAB with a FIIO E6 amp and there is no doubt that Panasonic hit it out of the park with this series of headphones. Everything I have thrown at these headphones has been met and exceeded in most cases. Loudness, bass response (not excessive, but to my liking), MP3's, Movies, Games, and the rest.  I am sure most would assume these would cost several times what they actually cost if given the opportunity to listen to them before purchase, but then again the ratings and actual popularity reflected on Amazon is not there by mistake by a long shot...these are great headphones and a great price.
I have a lot of ear buds, and for the price of these buds, these are the BEST in this price range. I have Sku11C@ndy, Bose (yes, a good set of Bose ear buds), S0ny and several other brands. THESE ear buds blow em all away. When I'm riding my KTM 500EXC, I will use Earbuds as plugs to muffle the sound, and provide music. These are my new GOTO set of earbuds for riding. The base is really good, and they seal up very well. These buds will allow you to slip em down into your ear a ways, and seal up your ear canal providing great sounding music. I'm so impressed with these I'll be ordering a couple more sets as backup sets.
The sound quality is really good for the price. I have owned more expensive earphones but these are better than many of them and couple that with free shipping and you get a very good deal.
I'm very pleased with these headphones. I purchased them to replace the original apple set that came with my ipod.  The panasonic set fits easily in my ears and doesn't slip out as the apple ones had.  The phones came with 3 different size inserts for the ear pieces.<br /><br />Sound quality is fine (I can't honestly say that it's better or worse than the others, but it's fine for me).  I was also concerned with the length of the cord, which has turned out to be ideal for my most frequent use: listening to music while I walk. They're the right length for my \\""wingspan\\"".<br /><br />They are advertised as noise-blocking and I was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to hear the traffic on my walks, but that has not been the case; I am well-able to hear what's going on around me, but not to the extent that it's distracting.<br /><br />I'm very happy with these and would highly recommend them to others.
Now I use headphones and find that most of these fall out of my ears. These do not and love that feature. I can run and they are still there. I have only two pairs of these and want to get another set, These are the best at not moving while doing yard work and want to listen to my mp3 players. I can not say a bad work on these. If you are looking for some cheaper headphones and want to keep them in your ears then look no farther. You will love these if you purchase.
best fit for small ears
At least best for me. I've had so many headphones, and most of them didn't sound as good as this one. But quality is not the best thing about this headphones. Who needs awesome quality, if the headphones just can't stay long in your ear and you need to put them back again and again. But that's not true about this headphones. I have a strange feeling, that my ears were created for this headphones, not vice versa.<br /><br />They stick easy and don't fall, don't change position, don't irritate. And I bought 2 of them.
They'll have really good quality, I was surprised they worked that well. I use them anytime I want to listen to music.
These sounded great but broke after about six months. The price makes replacing them a reasonable option, however.
the sound is nice ..... very comparable to the lenntik sonics 1's ..... for those that know.....<br />there is no way you can go wrong with these.... buy main or second pair trust me ...
Shaped to fit into the ear, clear, no complaints at all
great sound, esp at this price
head phones fit good and sound is great! i would recommend this for sure. no sliding out of the ear.
bought these for my boyfriends nephew. He had them one day and gave them to his &#34;girlfriend&#34; I was not to happy about that. Received the headphones in a decent amount of time.
most bang for your buck with these headphones. they are lightweight and fit my ears very comfortably. the only complaint i would have is that they tangle easily, but that's life for you.
Cheap (as in inexpensive), good sounding and fairly comfortable. For the price they can't be best.
This is another good deal from Amazon......I was not too much impressed with the quality of these.  they seem to be very thin  but they do have good sound
Its hard to find stuff that fits young kids well, this does the job well and the 8 year old hard critic likes this one very much.
Wow im amazed
I am rough on headphones and go through them fairly regularly. So I am always trying to find inexpensive headphones that sound better than my previous set (Skullcandy Ink'd). This time, after carefully reading reviews, I purchased 3 different headphones at once, all in the same price range
I was very surprised by the sound quality of these headphones, especially for under 10 bucks! I've owned a pair of these now for about 6 months, and I absolutely love them.
Sound is excellent.  Ear piece is not as comfortable as other earbuds I have used.
The headphones work perfectly with all of my devices. The look and sound quality is awesome! I will be purchasing another pair for my son.
Fit the ear perfectly, sound is 10x better than Apple's earpods and they don't fall out when I am running or working out.
These are inexpensive (though the price has been creeping up) and they do the job quite well. I've bought about 10 so far, between Christmas gifts and replacements. They are good enough to run with, to have in your ear at night, and cheap enough that when they inevitably break I just replace them.
the came pretty quick the quality are just the same as the Sony MDR-EX10LP and cost 5.00$ no doubt ill buy these again not only that they come in my favorite color purple
Great head phones.  Arrived quickly. A great bud for the price. Nice sound. Learned about them on today show as best value.
Low price, works great
Best headphone I ever imagined at this price.
Can't beat these at their price!  Comfortable for me and tones were clear and clean.  Not like my Bose, but for less than $7.00 shipped, they sound a lot better than some $20.00 headphones I've owned.
I liked these very much at first and was happy with my purchase. I am not sure if I just use and/or abuse the cords and ear buds, but I do use my earphones a LOT. I tried to be careful and after about 6 months, I bought new ones from Verizon and/or Apple. So far the company ones are doing much better.
I have a pair of Bose over-the-ear headphones that I use in general, but I was looking for a new set of earbuds to use when working out. I was looking at some of the more expensive in-ear headphones, but the reviews on these caught my eye so I decided to give them a shot. I wasn't disappointed. For the price, I didn't expect the quality that I ended up getting. These are definitely a good buy.
Incredibly good sound quality. I just got these today and compared them against my large Bose over ear headphones for sound quality and they are very very close! I mean my Bose sound great, and its hard to tell the difference with these ear buds. The inserts are also nice an tight so they should be good for working out and when I get sweating.<br />Thank you Panasonic for such high quality standards!
My go to earphones.
I ordered these because my other sets of earbuds were wearing out; I'm tough on them, so I go through a fair amount of pairs. These got such great reviews, but when I listened with them myself, I thought the sound wasn't even as good as the earbuds that came with my Sansa mp3 player! The bass isn't nonexistent, but all percussion sounds kind of tinny, and they aren't super comfortable even with the different size options. They're not terrible, but they're not as good as the reviews made me think they were. I'm probably just going to order some cheap Koss ones.
I had purchased these in blue a while back, but lost them - and I needed to get a new pair. After six months, these still worked perfectly, and the difference between these and my Apple headphones was astonishing: you can hear every note, every guitar pluck, every swell with so much more definition; and while they're not advertised as noise-canceling, they do a great job of blocking out other sounds.<br /><br />Even for people like me who are very sensitive to noise (and are bothered by louder noises), the headphones are just right on lower volume settings, which gives a lot of room to those who aren't as sensitive to noise.<br /><br />I also thought I wouldn't like the pink color since I'm not normally a big fan of pink, but it's the same color pink as the picture shows - a deep, ruby pink that looks really pretty in my opinion, and shines the same way the picture illustrates.<br /><br />These are the best pairs of headphones I've ever had, and they're really cheap; I highly recommend them!
I have been having these earphones for 6 months and they work perfectly and THEY'RE CHEAP. I would purchase them again.
good
These headphones were a gift for my mom, now I have to buy another pair for my girlfriend, they both loved them and said that they look great with their pink phone case.
Thought it had a speaker to use to talk .
Have been using them for over a month. Fit snugly and ok sound. Good value for money.
Great sound
Amazing quality for its price. Will buy again.
These headphones are fantastic!! Great sound and good price! A friend recommend these headphones to me when old headphones \\""kicked the bucket\\"". If you are a poor college kid like me you'll love them!
Great product!
Accidentally washed and dried with sheets, still worked!","Product: Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphone

Summary: 
Most reviewers are extremely pleased with the Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphone, noting its great value for money considering its sound quality, fit, and durability. The earbuds are praised for their snug fit, allowing them to stay put even during active exercises like running. However, some users reported that the size was not suitable for them. The sound quality consistently surprised users for being excellent for its low price with clear, balanced audio. Some, however, deemed the quality as average and lacking deep bass. The headphones seem to have a lifespan of a few months to over a year with some having issues with the earbuds conking out or becoming fragile over time. The earbuds were also lauded for being lightweight and comfortable, with a few exceptions. The design was well-received, specifically the variety of color options. A minor downside mentioned was their propensity to get tangled easily.

","It's funny, it's dark, it'll make you realize which of your friends are going to hell. And if you'll be joining them.<br /><br />The only downside is that you'll be tempted to play it a lot when you get it and overplaying it wears off the novelty. So pace yourself.
Fantastic game but the cardboard was ripped when I got it.
You can not go wrong with this game. Just need to get the expansion packs now. Even better to play while having a few beverages.
This is a very good party game as long as no one in the room is politically correct.  Highly recommend this game.
Purchased for my sister for Christmas!  Played it at our family Christmas dinner; it had us all in stitches!
LOVE THIS GAME!!!
Such a fun game - we've had a ton of fun nights with it already! It's only appropriate for adults!
While I am not sure about its educational value I rated this game 5 stars all around because it is that amazing. Apples to apples has become a game for sissies. This livens up any gathering or party!
As advertised with fast delivery. Thanks.
Never met anyone who doesn't like this game. Played it for hours with my suitemates and eventually 4 people turned into 16 people. DO NOT PLAY NEAR ADULTS OR MATURE PEOPLE.
This is an awesome game is you like Apples to Apples, although this game is geared towards people with a darker sense of humor. Not recommended for everyone.<br />It's pretty simple and a great group game.
Not for the faint of heart.
Have a soul?  You won't after this game.  Absolutely spectacular for naive friends and spouses.  The combinations of answers and responses are never-ending.
This game is just hilarious.  Its especially hilarious when you play it with your inlaws! Greatness.  I can see how it would get old quickly tho (after seeing all the cards they will loose their shock factor) so good thing they have the expansion packs.  I would buy them too.
Great game. I've played it with teens through senior citizens. Everyone had a blast. It's not something I would recommend you play with your church group.
fun game and a good price
This is the best, funniest card game ever invented! I LOVE it!!
Very great game
Amazing
Fun game to play with friends.
This game is hilarious! Some cards are terrible, but we just tossed them and added the expansion packs! :) :)
Love this game!
Great game, even better when you make it into a drinking game.
I got the game in time for Christmas with my family. We ended up going through all the white cards in the deck, which caused me to purchase both expansion packs! The game should probably not be played with children under 13 (plus or minus 3 years) or people who are easily offended by obscenity or political incorrectness.
What a riot!.
Fun, but not for the sensitive!
Great game. Played it for hours with family and friends
It's hard to say anything about this game that hasn't been said already. It's epic. If you have a sense of humor you will love it, if you're a stuck up prude you will absolutely hate it. For good fun invite some of the latter to play and watch the looks on their faces. Priceless.
Such an amazing game! I've played it before and wanted the game myself. Makes any night a great night and is a lot of fun to play.
Shipped Quickly and was exactly what it said it was.
Fun game!
Best social game out there! Fun!
Fun game but can get a little raunchy!  A game you might not want to play with strangers or someone you just met!
Most entertaining card game that I have ever played!  Definitely not for the faint of heart or easily offended.. once you play, you are hooked and buy your own copy of Cards Against Humanity.  Plenty of expansion packs to upgrade your deck with, and plenty of ways to liven up any gathering!
Funniest game ever!
A group of friends and I sat down with a few glasses of wine and started playing at 10pm. When we got to the last card it was pushing 2am and I can honestly say I laughed so hard it hurt. I felt that game for like 3 days afterwards.
Great and fun game for people with a good sense of humor
So much fun... just beware it's not for children or those without a warped sense of humor.  :-)
My husband and I played this game with our good friends. Now they're our best friends.<br /><br />Note: you really do have to be horrible people to enjoy the game.
Awesome game
Great game for the inappropriate party crowds:)
If you want a new and original game to play with friends, Card Against Humanity is a great choice. Its fun, raunchy, and infinitely entertaining!
I play this game at holiday parties. My cousins and I end up crying in laughter. We are bad people. But this game is amazing.
This game is so much fun!  It is definitely for ages 17 and over and for those that are not easily offended, but if you have a group of friends that like games, it's a good time!
Funniest card game I have ever played with friends and family.
Not for people under 18 but awfully fun for a few drinks and great friends
i got this for my brother for christmas and we all sat around and played it for hours. i laughed so hard i had trouble reading the cards
Not only was the product in perfect condition when it arrived but the game itself is just hilarious! It is a great game for small and large groups alike and it has so many possibilities. I would definitely recommend this product to others! I plan on buying the remaining expansion packs for the game as well!
So much fun! Love it. Great for get togethers and will leave everyone in stitches
Best card game, hands down! I've never laughed so hard playing a card game.
Great
This game is hilarious. It is like mad lib for perverted adults. It is incredibly entertaining and some of the cars combos are absolutely hysterical. Anything card combo with Beiber is hilarious. Gotta get it.  NOT FOR KIDS
If you have ever played apples to apples, this is basically the adult version. Hours of entertainment for many people. Hilariously awesome.
Looooooooove this game. Hard to stop, warning extra fun when drunk with friends.
We adore this game!  It is lots of fun.  I think our favorite part is that it comes with blank cards.  So if you think of something that would have been hysterical, you can make your own.  If you haven't ever played you have missed out!!!
I've played this a couple times now with 2 different groups of people and have been rolling on the floor laughing both times. I would suggest you know who you're playing with so you don't offend anyone as the cards can be pretty vulgar. But with a group of friends there isn't another game I would rather play.
This takes party games to a whole new level! If you want hours of intense laughter, this is your ticket! This game is guaranteed to bring you to tears, OF LAUGHTER! Be prepared for your friends create the most bizarre, disgusting and completely hilarious responses to the random topics. As it says, &#34;A Card Game for Horrible People!&#34; It's so wrong, but so right at the same time!
So much fun to play!
Look gorgeous fit very well.thanks
Not for the politically correct.
An ultimate game for any party. This game will have you laughing the entire time you play and it makes for some great memories. Order the expansion packs immediately!
Well, you have to print it yourself, but it beats paying 50+ bucks for it here with the re-sellers. Once the manufacturer has more available, you can buy it!<br /><br />It's fun fun fun!!
Clearly there is a typo here 249.99 should be 24.99. No one in their right mind would ever pay that much for a card game you can get for $25...... Plan to get the game but guess I'm waiting now.
The delivery was timely. I bought this as a gift and it is a game that was highly recommended from a like minded friend. I can't wait to play it.
Disgusting game. Some of the cards are anti-Christian and anti-Semetic. The game started off amusing enough, but soon left us ready to toss it in the trash.
I played cards against humanity with my siblings and we went through every single card in one night. They should provide more cards.
Fun. We laughed for 2 hours.
Service was fast, easy, and reliable. This game is hilarious and guaranteed and great time for our group of friends.
My uncle flew in from overseas and had never heard of this game. He was only here for 48 hours, so I selected the overnight shipping option for $9. It worked out great since I would not have been able to purchase the game from the Cards Against Humanity company and have it in time. This came the following morning to my door step.
Greatest Of All Time.<br /><br />Seriously, what more is there to say that hasn't already been said. New hilarity ensues every time the box opens. Always grab these when they are in stock. I gave a set this year to my parents who are 70 and they laughed their faces off.","Product: Cards Against Humanity
Summary: A boardgame riddled with dark humor, Cards Against Humanity seems to be the ideal game for adult get-togethers. It appears to be highly engaging, with many users lamenting how they've spent hours laughing and playing it. Despite its crudeness, it is described as a fantastic game that is worth meeting up with friends for. Reviews suggest it livens up any gathering with its irreverent humor, though caution that it's not for sensitive or easily offended individuals, and it's definitely not appropriate for children or underage individuals. Some users did report issues, such as damaged product upon delivery and running out of cards quickly due to the highly addictive nature of the game.

","perfect....just what I needed!
Fantastic device. We purchased 3. The kids free time app is exactly what I needed to control the safety and appropriateness of content viewed by my 10 year old. I would like to see a few things updated such as what is unlimited and just for purchase on my wish list without having to open the book information. It would be nice to be able to just return unlimited books to the shop without checking out to get that option as we share the unlimited account and are unsure what people have finished (it would be nice to have a pop up at the last page of the book).
Without a microSD slot for additional storage, I won't be interested. I am aware that cloud storage is available, but Amazon and these other companies that produce devices with no expandable storage need to understand that WiFi is simply not as all-pervasive as they believe. In my small town, when I'm not at home or at a few commercial locations I'm off the grid and restricted to the content that can be stored on the device itself.
I love it! It's so easy to use and everything you need is at the push of a button.
Love this
Loved it....and loved the apps for my 5 year old! Was able to do 2 separate accounts on it for each of us and use parental controls to block purchases, Web activity and unauthorized apps!
Everything I expected and more. Perfect size. I love it!
Sounds a bit like old-school with a twist of the new...
Additional ads are an invasion and horrible to deal with.  You might as well by the full price one because they shove the ads down your throat and you have to PAY to get rid of them.  I just feel like I should control the content on the device I bought.  Kindle is soul-less for this level of advertising.  Shame.  I will be returning for another brand.
A little heavier than expected. But satisfactory experience
Very nice but maybe a little too small for a reading for a long time.  Stays charged well.
I returned the kindle because the battery had to be recharge daily.
fast and relaible so far
We got it for my daughter and she loves it!
This thing is great! Easy to use, has all the features needed for an on the go life!
Great device..My kids love them.
The apps available are limited, the Internet app is awful, the tablet is ridiculously slow. You can't add extra storage and this only hold about 3 downloaded movies (which unless you are in wifi, you can only watch once in 24 hours, horrible for road trips!) I ended up buying a galaxy tab and giving this to my daughter. If you're just using it for Netflix and reading, I'm sure you will be satisfied.
No.  I expected the battery to last much, much longer according to the write-ups.<br />No other comments as I don't use it for anything except reading books.  Having to turn it off after each use really makes it difficult to pick up and continue reading if you have to wait for it to load every time.  If I don't turn it off, the battery runs down right away.
I really like my new Kindle Fire HD6. Still getting used to it but it's just what I wanted.
Great. Just wish i could buy more GB or had a Sim card insertion.
I had to replace the first Kindle Fire 6. Hopefully,; I won't have any problems with this one. So far so good!!
It was a gift from my sister which I was very surprised at how easy it is to run.  I will sell my Windows 8.1 and get an Mac  IPad . This device has turned the way I look at things differently.
This Kindle is a great size!  I find it easy to use and would recommend it to anyone.
A great little tablet for reading, Internet surfing, Netflix, and gaming. The Fire HD 6 is the perfect size for travel and for watching Netflix in bed. It works faster with the home Wi-Fi than my smartphone does.<br /><br />It comes with the charger/adapter. A USB cord and the wall adapter come in the box. There's no need to order one separately like it suggested I do while ordering.<br /><br />The only thing I thought was weird was that there is not a YouTube app available, but Bing is the browser homepage, YouTube is with Google.
Great product for the price.
I loved my kindle.  I have yet to learn all I can do with it.
So far this has done everything I had hoped it would and I will be a happy camper if it continues to do so. This is the best tablet I found anywhere near this price point.
excellent product, would recommend anyone buy this fire tablet, is user friendly and very nice looking
I love it, it's our second one
Very satisfied with shipping and communcation.
It was the perfect gift
Very happy with the Fire HD 6! I love it!
Love it
Awesome products.
works as advertised and then some
Best kindle fire 6
I bought 2 tablets one for my 10 yr old and one for my 6 year old mainly so they would stop bugging me for my phone to play games. One of the main reasons I bought these tablets was because my oldest likes to play Clash of Clans and my younger one likes Minecraft but to my surprise the Clash of Clan game was not available for download and Minecraft was but for $6.99. I called to speak with a representative about it and he said that the developer's for Clash of Clan have not made the game available for this tablet. I wish I would have known that before I bought them. Otherwise the tablets have been working okay but I've only had them for a week.
My girls are thrilled!!!!!
I find this product to be more useful than I had originally anticipated and I'm happy that it is.
Fantastic. Just as described
Decent product but not really great for what I intended. I wanted a small tablet for my 4 and 6 year olds that I was able to easily control what they were able to doing. I thought the Free Time app would be PERFECT! What I did not realize was that it would use up so much of the 8GB that I could only put 4 or 5 apps on each Kindle. So the devices work great but the 8GB are too small to use with Free Time.
Ok I bought this about a year ago and it worked fine I loved it. Then before I knew it stopped charging and the battery ran out fast. It would be on the charger for days and like it never even noticed the charger. All in all it was good for a while but buyers beware it will break down within 1-2 years!!!!!
Bought it for my niece and she loves it. Its just the right size for her to carry around. Only thing I don't like about it is how long it takes to charge.
Great!!!
Easy to get started. Still learning all the different sites. Like it for the size and all the options that it offers.
perfect product  to keep my 18 month old occupied
Love my new Kindle! My old one went kaput after 3 years of daily use, so I decided to replace it. Couldn't be happier with my choice. Love the camera & the size, as well as the faster downloading.
It's Awesome!
bought it for my wife, she likes it uses for reading books so far, not tried any other features yet
This is a great tablet. I love being able to surf Amazon on the device and that it came with my Amazon account preloaded. The speaker is good and loud so watching videos with out headsets is an easy affair. The app store has a good library of games and apps that rivals googles. The two probelms that I have with the tablet is the lack of micro SD slot and the fact that the sleep function doesn't seem to reserve battery power seeing as it have died on me a few times over night cause I didn't charge it that day.
Best $99 tablet on the market gives Apple a run for its money however app market needs to be expanded vastly
Wife wanted the 16GB version so I kept the 8gb for myself and ordered her the 16GB
Enjoying the new Kindle Fire. We have become quite the Kindle addicts at our house. Everyone has their own and we all download books and games.
it is all well and good but I cannot see to readin full light-- outside
It works better than advertised
I'm really satisfied with it.
I find the display crisp and clean.  The Fire is the right size for my hands. I have tead a book, played games.  I am Happy with ot.
The fire itself is fine.  No issues.  The biggest challenge for us, is that you can't let kids pick their own apps.  This has nothing to do with the device, but rather the way the store works.  Setting a kids profile locks the kid out of the store.  Opening an adult profile to a kid means the kid can download at will without any control.  Compared to apple and android stores this is a real shortcoming with the kindle store.
Freezes up easily. But,  still like it very much. Have a lot to learn about it. There were no instructions. Since this is my first &#34;Fire&#34;, I'm learning on my own.
I WILL LIKE IT BETTER WHEN HAVING BECOME MORE ADEPT
Excellent item, fast shipping
I like it a lot. I have had trouble with the clould uploading photos and can't get candy crush soda but other than that very pleased.
Bought it for my daughter, she loves it. It is my families 4th kindle.
Bought it for my son. He loves it.
Cool
Not what I wanted so I sent it back.
i got this for $30 less than it regularly sells for and thats the only reason i got it. i wanted the 7&#34; as this isnt much bigger than my phone.<br /><br />i got it for my son and he loves it. it does everything i wanted and i love having full control over what he can do. he can only use certain apps, so he cant get to anything he doesnt need.<br /><br />he cant make any purchases without my password<br /><br />it gets plenty loud, looks great, fast enough.<br /><br />so far only thing bad ive noticed is it doesnt hold a charge that great, but luckily it comes with a charger and fits my car charger in the car<br /><br />for the price its perfect for a kid or if you need something and dont have a phone
Love love love!! Best purchase ever!
I was glad I purchased this item. It is absolutely perfect. Amazon has excellent customer service too!
I want to say first off that didn't buy this version but I bought the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. That being said, I will NEVER AGAIN buy an Amazon made electronic device. The kindle fire I purchased died after 3 months. When I contacted Amazon, they were happy to send me a new one. 2 days later, a REFURBISHED one came. When I contacted them again, they told me that because it was an &#34;older model&#34; now, they couldn't guarantee a new kindle. So, I asked for a full refund. Which they did today. Minus an $30 &#34;restocking&#34; fee. WTF? I had been thinking of getting the newer kindle fire but this has changed my mind. shame on you, Amazon. It's one thing if I had returned it because i didn't like it but this was all YOUR issue, not mine! Buyers, be warned! You're probably better off paying more for another brand!","Product: Fire HD 6

Summary: Users have a largely positive experience with the Fire HD 6, praising its ease of use, especially for children through the Free Time app that allows parental control. It's been noted as a fantastic device for its price point and serves its purpose well for basic uses such as surfing, reading and Netflix. Additionally, its size was considered perfect for many users, as it's portable and lightweight. Many appreciated the initial battery life and speed, with some expressing that it offered more than they anticipated. However, there were recurring complaints about the lack of expandable storage and the inability to download certain popular apps, such as Clash of Clans. Customers also expressed dissatisfaction with the compulsory ads which they deemed invasive. Several reviews mention a gradual decrease in the battery life over time, with a need for frequent charging, and some devices not charging at all after a year or less of use, indicating potential longevity issues. Furthermore, many found it difficult to use outside in full light.
